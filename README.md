# Prime-Based Backoff Algorithm

This project implements a backoff algorithm inspired by the prime number sequence from the movie *Contact*. It uses prime numbers as retry intervals and includes integration tests for load testing.

## Features

- Prime-based backoff intervals (2s, 3s, 5s, 7s, 11s, ...).
- Integration tests using Vegeta for HTTP load testing.
- Docker and Docker Compose support for local development and testing.
- GitHub Actions for automated testing.
